# Goal explore properties of lncRNA and protein coding genes using R-code!
We just finished last lesson with exploring some legnth features of genes.
Mostly using the filter button on the R-studio viewer. Now let's ask these 
questions on genome-wide scale using R-code.


# First explore the length of genes in the mouse genome 

```{R mRNA gene width}

load("/scratch/Shares/rinnclass/MASTER_CLASS/STUDENTS/reanna/MASTER_CLASS/lessons/08_ATACseq_pipeline/mv25_gencode_GRanges.Rdata")

# here we are filtering our gencode_gr_length data frame above using the column names (e.g., gene_type)
# parameters/syntax for filter(data.frame, col-name1 == " character" )
# We will filter to just "protein_coding" and "genes" as there are other annotations such as exons etc.

mrna_df <- filter(gencode_gr_length, gene_type == "protein_coding", type == "gene")

# How many mRNAs do you think there are in the mouse genome?

# Let's explore how big genes are !
# we can easily plot a histogram of mRNA gene widths.
hist(log10(mrna_df$width), breaks = 60)

# same for lncRNAs (here they are called "lincRNA")
lncrna_df <- filter(gencode_gr_length, gene_type == "lincRNA", type == "gene")

# plotting lncRNA
hist(log10(lncrna_df$width), breaks = 60)

# Let's see what the average gene size is. Note we can no longer use width in a DF
mean(lncrna_df$width)
# 20164.11
mean(mrna_df$width)
# 49331.56

# this all points to mRNAs being 2x longer than lncRNAs.
# Note this is for genebody length -- we will do more with exons below.
```


# How many types of "gene types" are there?

Here we will index into gencode_gr to $type
this has all the info of types of genes included.
```{R gene types}

# indexing into gene typse 
table(gencode_gr@elementMetadata$type)

## cool this tell us a lot about the genome with one line!

# Moving forwrard we will use the "$type" "genes"
```

# Finding genome feature lengths
let's find the longest and shortest genes in the genome!
But first let's see how to find the lengths of genome features.
```{R annotation lengths} 

# Let's see the range of gene sizes
summary(width(gencode_gr))

```

interesting some genes are just 1 nt long!
let's look into that some more

# what annotaitons have width of 1nt?
```{R annotation widths of 1 ?}
# we will use indexing and setting a value of 1 and making DF
width_1_items <- gencode_gr[width(gencode_gr) == 1] %>%
  as.data.frame()

# let's look
table(width_1_items$type)
# so weird that a CDS can be 1nt or an exon.

# looking for weird exons and coding sequences as 1nt ? 
weird_cds <- width_1_items %>% 
  filter(type == "CDS")

```

huh 294 Coding Sequences (CDS) are 1 nt -- annotations are never perfect :)
It's about 1% error - not too bad !


# Anyways: One thing that should be 1nt long is a TSS.
Speaking of transcriptional start site(TSS) this is a super handy feature.
Something we would want to overlap our ATACseq peaks with to see how many peaks
are near genes versus not near genes etc. And or what genes have peaks and which don't.

TSS: actual start of gene transcript
Promoter: the region of regulation for turning gene on or off.

# defining gene TSS or promoter regions (super-useful!!) 
To do this we will use the GenomicRanges function "promoters"
Let's go!
```{R annotation widths of 1 ?}

# The promoters function defines the TSS and input bases up and downstream.
# Parameters are some gene annotation of interest: let's use "gene"
tss <- promoters(gencode_gr[gencode_gr$type == "gene"], 
                 upstream = 0, downstream = 0) %>%
  as.data.frame()

# we see 55,401 TSS. Let's see if that is the same as # of genes
summary(gencode_gr[gencode_gr$type == "gene"])
# cool the same

```

# What is the shortest gene?
Here we will bring together our indexing and filter skills
```{shortest gene in human genome}
# Let's turn gencode_gr into a data.frame and filter to only genes.
gencode_df <- gencode_gr %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  filter(type == "gene")

# Let's find the smallest genes using "arrange" function
gencode_df %>% 
  arrange(gencode_df$width) %>%
  head()

# Voila here is the shortest gene (8nt long ??): TRDD1
# seqnames     start       end width strand source type score phase              gene_id       gene_type gene_name level      mgi_id          havana_gene transcript_id
# 1    chr12 113454942 113454951    10      - HAVANA gene    NA    NA ENSMUSG00000094957.1       IG_D_gene   Ighd5-5     2 MGI:4937334 OTTMUSG00000051531.2          <NA>

# now the longest gene using -arrange
```{longest  gene in human genome}

# Now let's find the Largest genes using arrange
gencode_df %>%
  arrange(-width) %>%
  head()

# seqnames     start       end   width strand source type score phase               gene_id      gene_type gene_name level      mgi_id           havana_gene transcript_id
# 1     chr8 119910841 124345722 4434882      + HAVANA gene    NA    NA  ENSMUSG00000092329.1 protein_coding   Galnt2l     2 MGI:5141853  OTTMUSG00000026145.5          <NA>

# We can also store the longest gene as an object with max function
longest_gene <- gencode_df %>%
  filter(width == max(width))

# let's take a look at what information we have for this gene:
longest_gene

```

Now let's find the total amount of the genome covered by exons.
We start by defining total_exon_length of all exons in genome.

# we need to use reduce to collapse all the exons that overlap into the longest exon
# Exon 1.1  _____________
# Exon 1.2      _____________
# reduce    _________________
# intersect     _________


Ok let's find out what % of genome is exons!

# What percetnage of the genome (3Billion) are exons?
```{R % of genome that is exons}
# first we will make an object of exons and reduce them as described above
total_exon_length <- gencode_gr[gencode_gr$type == "exon"] %>%
  # now reduce will take the union of overlapping exons 
  GenomicRanges::reduce() %>% 
  width() %>%
  sum()

# We now have the total bases covered by exons in the human genome. We also know
# the human genome is 3.9B base pairs so let's find the percentage by division:

total_exon_length/3.2e9
# Boom we can see the mouse genome is about 4% exons (spoiler human genome is 4% too)!

# if we want to plot the range of exon sizes we simply remove the sum function and plot:
exon_lengths <- gencode_gr[gencode_gr$type == "exon"] %>%
  # now reduce will take the union of overlapping exons 
  GenomicRanges::reduce() 

# plotting
hist(width(exon_lengths), breaks = 100, xlim = c(0,10000))
# we see most exons are under 2kb what is the average?

avergage_exon_length <- mean(width(exon_lengths))
# Cool the average exon length is 454nt (human 444nt) !
```

# what percentage of the genome is comprised of gene bodies?
```{R % of genome that is Gene bodies}

# To do this we simply change index in $type to == gene
reduced_gene_bodies <- gencode_gr[gencode_gr$type == "gene"] %>%
  GenomicRanges::reduce() %>%
  width() %>%
  sum()

reduced_gene_bodies/3.2e9
# Woah gene bodies take up 40% of the mouse genome !!

# lets' see the range of sizes (take out width and sum from above)
gene_body_lengths <- gencode_gr[gencode_gr$type == "gene"] %>%
  GenomicRanges::reduce()

# plotting
hist(width(gene_body_lengths), breaks = 100, xlim = c(0,500000))

# we see most are less than 200Kb long (we previous saw longest was over 500Kb !)

# what is the average length of a gene body?

mean(width(gene_body_lengths))

# answer is 26,522 or ~27Kb (38Kb human) !
